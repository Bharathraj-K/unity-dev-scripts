# Unity Tutorial Scripts ðŸŽ®

This repository contains short and reusable Unity scripts featured in my tutorials.

ðŸ“Œ Topics covered so far:
- Flashlight toggle
- Door interaction
- Note pickup system
- Outline highlighting (Quick Outline)
- Picking Up and Throwing an object

Each script is designed to be plug-and-play for quick prototyping in Unity 3D using C# and URP.
